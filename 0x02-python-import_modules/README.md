# 0x02: Python: Import & Modules

This repository focuses on Python scripts that demonstrate the usage of module imports and cover various programming concepts. Each Python script serves a specific purpose, contributing to the understanding of Python's capabilities and functionalities.

## Overview

Python's modularity is one of its key strengths, allowing developers to reuse code efficiently by importing modules.

Modules are files containing Python code and data, which can be accessed by other Python programs. These scripts showcase how to leverage module imports for different programming tasks.

## Files and Descriptions

Below is a summary of each Python script and its purpose:

| File Name                | Function                                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mandatory**               |
| `0-add.py`                |	Adds two numbers.       |
| `0-import_add.py`         |	Imports add function from `add_0.py` and performs addition.     |
| `1-calculation.py`        |	Imports functions from `calculator_1.py` and performs calculations. |
| `2-args.py`               |	Prints the number of arguments and their values.        |
| `3-infinite_add.py`	    |   Adds an arbitrary number of integer arguments.      |
| `4-hidden_discovery.py`   |	Lists non-hidden attributes of `hidden_4.pyc`.        |
| `5-variable_load.py`      |	Imports variable a from `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.  |
| **Helper functions**          |
| `add_0.py`        |	Contains an add function for addition.  |
| `calculator_1.py` |	Contains basic mathematical operations (add, sub, mul, div).    |
| `hidden_4.pyc`    |	A compiled Python bytecode file.
| **Advanced**              |
| `100-my_calculator.py`        |	Performs basic arithmetic operations based on command-line arguments.   |
| `101-easy_print.py`	        |   Prints "Hello, world!" using a compact method.      |
| `102-magic_calculation.py`    |   Python function `magic_calculation(a, b)` replicating given bytecode.     |
| `103-fast_alphabet.py`        |	Prints the uppercase alphabet in three lines.       |

These Python scripts cover various programming concepts, from basic arithmetic operations to more advanced Python functionalities.
